# Task1Iot
in this task we where assign to right an sudo algorithm to control 6 servo motors that control robot movement.
1- we need to initialize instance  for each motor(left hip,right feet etc..)  and set the initial position. 
2-make functions that recives user input to to control the robot movment (forward,backword,left,right)( for example we can use esp 32 and use blynk to control the robot)
3-make function that receivse input from user controling functiuons and make the kinematics calculation
4- make function that that receives  input from the kinematics function then update the servo postion accordingly 
5-in the setup function we can but a bud rate rate so we can debug using the serial monitor, then we attach  the servo motor to there respective pins, then  we set initial servo postion
6-the in the loop we put the function that we want it to run repeatedly.
